SDA Borathon - VMWare

The Idea:

What if the different machine learning projects across VMware, that target learning from cloud infrastructure, could be leveraged to innovate into a self-driving admin for those infrastructures?

At RADiO 2017, I was enamored by two things:

Stephen Wolfram's demo on how data could be leveraged to see and do things that humans cannot.
The paradigm of "self-driving admin", as it was discussed between Pat Gelsinger and the panel on our partnership with DELL.

The POC:

What we did at Borathon can be understood as the combining of these two ideas. Our POC effort involved the following:

Develop a decision tree engine that can look at cloud usage and classify optimizations.
On the basis of identified optimizations, further identify best cloud instance across the hybrid cloud.
Engage the human admin with the self-driving admin over a communication channel, that can be fully engaged with over mobile devices, while watching a movie.

The Future:

We believe the POC we did is a harbinger of things to come. Eventually a self-driving admin should do everything a human admin would, just better, with an in-depth knowledge of what is happening. Imagine the following:

A SDA that use neural networks to identify the features that affect cloud usage, efficiency, optimization etc.
A SDA that uses predictive analysis to perform self-healing.
A SDA that make administration of large enterprise level hybrid cloud infrastructure less and less human dependent.
A SDA that allows the experience of managing large scale infrastructures as easy as interacting with your friends over chat.
[Fill this list with something powerful and adventurous you can envision.]
